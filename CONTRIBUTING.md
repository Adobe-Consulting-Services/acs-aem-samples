# Contributing to ACS AEM Samples

Here are some of the ways you can contribute to ACS AEM Samples:

* Contribute new samples: services, components, front end code, whateverâ€¦
* Samples should be generic and illustrate general use of AEM building blocks.
* Samples should be heavily commented describing WHAT and WHY code does.
* Report or fix any bugs or inefficiencies.
* Participate in code reviews.
