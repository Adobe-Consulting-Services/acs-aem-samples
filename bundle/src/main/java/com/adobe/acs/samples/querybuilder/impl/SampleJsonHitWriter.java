    Interface documentation: http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/javadoc/com/day/cq/search/writer/ResultHitWriter.html

    ResultHitWriter writes a search result Hit into a JSONWriter.
    This is used in the standard servlet for the query builder to allow different output renderings.

    The appropriate ResultHitWriter is selected by passing the desired name
    in the query using p.hitwriter=NAME as request parameter.

    Implementations of this interface must be defined as an OSGi component factory.
    The name of the factory must be the fully qualified name of this interface plus "/" and a distinct short name of
    the renderer (that will be used in request parameters to select it, NAME above).

    An example call to this Sample HitWriter might look like:

        http://localhost:4502/bin/querybuilder.json?...&p.hitwriter=acs-commons-sample

    Resulting JSON object would look like:

        [
            ...,
            {
                "path": "/content/path/to/hit",
                "key-to-use-in-json": "Hit Title (pulled from jcr:content node)",
                "complex": "Hello World"
            },
            ...
        ]
